This is the output of a long-lasting project that addressed CME interactions with our magnetosphere, other deprecated files can be found on my repositories related to Arasci and SMFGF. The first step was creating a data framework that allows a fast workflow: [CorKit](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/corkit) and [StarStream](https://github.com/Jorgedavyd/StarStream) were first developed for the research community to have go directly to the next step of the machine learning pipeline.

## Data

% TODO, acknowledgement for data from LASCO, SDO, DSCOVR, ACE, SOHO, WIND

## Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't be possible without the initiative of Arasci, I appreciate the unique team the we have created in NASA Space Apps Challenge to address a scalable solution. Also, without the encouragement recieved from Universidad Comunera (UCOM) from Paraguay, it wouldn't be possible to reach to the high-end journals to publish the work, I'm very grateful for all the support.
