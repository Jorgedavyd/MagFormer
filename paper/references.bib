abstract = {Abstract The geomagnetically induced current (GIC) produced during extreme geomagnetic storms can easily lead to large-scale blackouts in China due to the increase in the scale of its electric power grid. A power grid's resilience is its capability to resist various natural hazards, withstand primary failures, and quickly resume normal operation. To avoid power grid damages, this study developed a resilient power grid, incorporating failure, power flow calculation and recovery models under a uniform induced geoelectric field. We chose a system's performance loss as the resilience evaluation indicator, which intuitively reflected a system's loss under GIC. In addition, the recovery model was optimized using a genetic algorithm, and two resilience improvement measures were proposed. The IEEE-RTS-79 system, consisting of 10 generators, 24 buses and 5 transformers, was chosen as an example to verify the feasibility of this study. The results show that the genetic algorithm and optimization measures effectively enhanced the system's resilience indicator and provided a reference for preventing system damages under GIC and quick recovery after possible failures.},

title = {Physics-driven Machine Learning for the Prediction of Coronal Mass Ejections’ Travel Times},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) correspond to dramatic expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the solar corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are scientifically relevant because they are involved in the physical mechanisms characterizing the active Sun. However, more recently, CMEs have attracted attention for their impact on space weather, as they are correlated to geomagnetic storms and may induce the generation of solar energetic particle streams. In this space weather framework, the present paper introduces a physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the prediction of CMEs’ travel time, in which the deterministic drag-based model is exploited to improve the training phase of a cascade of two neural networks fed with both remote sensing and in situ data. This study shows that the use of physical information in the AI architecture significantly improves both the accuracy and the robustness of the travel time prediction.}
