A full three-dimensional compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation was conducted to distinguish between the heating mechanisms in the fast solar wind above the open field region. Our simulation describes the evolution of the Alfvénic waves, which includes the compressible effects from the photosphere to the heliospheric distance s of 27 solar radii (R⊙). The hot corona and fast solar wind were reproduced simultaneously due to the dissipation of the Alfvén waves. The inclusion of the transition region and lower atmosphere enabled us to derive the solar mass-loss rate for the first time by performing a full three-dimensional compressible MHD simulation. The Alfvén turbulence was determined to be the dominant heating mechanism in the solar wind acceleration region (s \&gt; 1.3 R⊙), as suggested by previous solar wind models. In addition, shock formation and phase mixing are important below the lower transition region (s \&lt; 1.03 R⊙) as well.}",

    abstract = {Abstract The geomagnetically induced current (GIC) produced during extreme geomagnetic storms can easily lead to large-scale blackouts in China due to the increase in the scale of its electric power grid. A power grid's resilience is its capability to resist various natural hazards, withstand primary failures, and quickly resume normal operation. To avoid power grid damages, this study developed a resilient power grid, incorporating failure, power flow calculation and recovery models under a uniform induced geoelectric field. We chose a system's performance loss as the resilience evaluation indicator, which intuitively reflected a system's loss under GIC. In addition, the recovery model was optimized using a genetic algorithm, and two resilience improvement measures were proposed. The IEEE-RTS-79 system, consisting of 10 generators, 24 buses and 5 transformers, was chosen as an example to verify the feasibility of this study. The results show that the genetic algorithm and optimization measures effectively enhanced the system's resilience indicator and provided a reference for preventing system damages under GIC and quick recovery after possible failures.},

    abstract = {Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) correspond to dramatic expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the solar corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are scientifically relevant because they are involved in the physical mechanisms characterizing the active Sun. However, more recently, CMEs have attracted attention for their impact on space weather, as they are correlated to geomagnetic storms and may induce the generation of solar energetic particle streams. In this space weather framework, the present paper introduces a physics-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the prediction of CMEs’ travel time, in which the deterministic drag-based model is exploited to improve the training phase of a cascade of two neural networks fed with both remote sensing and in situ data. This study shows that the use of physical information in the AI architecture significantly improves both the accuracy and the robustness of the travel time prediction.}

    abstract={The predictions of plasma parameters in the interplanetary medium are the core of space weather forecasts, and the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical simulation is an important tool in the prediction of plasma parameters. Operational space weather forecasts are commonly produced by a heliosphere model whose inner boundary is set at 18 R<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> or beyond. Such predictions typically use empirical/physics-based inner boundary conditions to solve the MHD equations for numerical simulation. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the numerical modeling of the inner heliosphere. In this paper, the numerical modeling of solar wind and coronal mass ejection in the inner heliosphere is reviewed. In particular, different inner boundary conditions used in the simulation are investigated since the MHD solutions are predetermined by the treatment of the inner boundary conditions to a large extent. Discussion is made on further development of the heliosphere model.</p>}
